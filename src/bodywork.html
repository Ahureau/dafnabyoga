            The sessions
          </h2>
          <p>In holistic bodywork sessions, I use different tools I have acquired over the years to invite more balance, relaxation and ease in the body. Here are some of the approaches that guide me in my work.</p>
          <div class="paraH3">
            <h3>Osteopathy</h3>
            <p>
              Osteopathy is a holistic form of manual therapy focused on the entire body. Using a wide range of techniques to restore existing imbalances, the osteopath helps the body in its self-healing process. Osteopathy can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their physical health and wellbeing, from athletes and active individuals to those suffering from chronic pain or injury.

          <div class="paraH3">
            <h3>Reflexology</h3>
            <p>
              Reflexology is a method that focuses on diagnosing and treating the body and mind through the feet and hands. By working on specific reflex points, we can address various issues of the body, including digestive, endocrine, orthopedic, nervous, and respiratory systems. Reflexology is ideal for those seeking an internal balance, relaxation, and peacefulness.

          <div class="paraH3">
            <h3>Body-Mind Centering</h3>
            <p>
              Body-Mind Centering (BMC) connects movement, body, and consciousness. It explores the relationship between mind and body through movement, touch, voice, and awareness. The approach emphasizes the integration of body systems using principles from anatomy and development.            </p>
