            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              As a fourth-year student at the Swiss International School of Osteopathy (SICO), I am certified in Structural & Craniosacral Osteopathy.
              <br><br>
              Osteopathy is a holistic approach to healthcare that focuses on the musculoskeletal system and its connection to overall health. Osteopaths believe that the body has the ability to heal itself and they use manual techniques to help facilitate this process. By manipulating the muscles, bones, and joints, osteopaths help to relieve pain, improve mobility, and promote overall wellness. Osteopathy can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their physical health and wellbeing, from athletes and active individuals to those suffering from chronic pain or injury.

                I graduated two years in Reidman College, Tel Aviv. I then continued my learning journey with different techniques such as Osteopathic Reflexology, Body Mind Centering®, and more.

                Reflexology is a non-invasive method that focuses on diagnosing and treating the body and mind through the feet and hands. By working on specific reflex points, we can address various issues of the body, including digestive, endocrine, orthopedic, nervous, and respiratory systems. Reflexology is a holistic treatment that can also help with mental states such as anxiety, depression, and stress. It supports the natural process of healing, making it an ideal choice for those seeking and internal balance, relaxation, and peacefulness.
